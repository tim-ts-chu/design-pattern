## Strategy Pattern
### Definition
Strategy pattern is that we try to find out the changed parts, and encapsulate it. This pattern make the core algorithms be alternated easily without effecting the current program which is not related with changed parts.

### Rules
1. Encapsulate changed parts
2. Use composition more, inheritance less
3. Write program based on interface instead of implementation

### Applications
* neuron network -> activation function
* read/write -> compression algorithm

### Example
